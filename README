DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~
	RawVideoPlayer is a simple utility intended for Video Engineers
	to view/compare the Raw Video Files. It can play one/two files 
	at a time. All the Raw (YUV/RGB) formats are supported. The
	framerate, displaywidth and displayheight can be modified.

The different Raw Video Formats supported are:

	+-------------------------------------------+
	|					|						|
	|	yuv420			|		yuv444 Planar	|
	|	yvu420			|		yvu444 Planar	|
	|					|		uyv444 Planar	|
	|	yuv422			|		             	|
	|	yvu422			|		yuv444 Packed	|
	|	      			|		yvu444 Packed	|
	|	uyvy  			|		uyv444 Packed	|
	|	yuyv			|		             	|
	|	yvyu  			|		             	|
	|	          		|		             	|
	+-------------------------------------------+

	For all formats both Progressive and Interlaced 
	formats are supported.


	RawVideoPlayer uses OpenGL GLUT for Video Rendering. So
	in order to build from the sources, OpenGL and OpenGL GLUT
	needs to be installed.

	You can download OpenGL and GLUT packages from:
		OpenGL 1.1:	http://www.berkelium.com/OpenGL/sgi-download.html
		GLUT 3.0  :	http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/

COMPILATION
~~~~~~~~~~~

Unix Like Systems:

	Type make
	This will create the executable.

Windows:
	
	VC++ 6.0 Project is included in the package.
	Open the Project and compile to get the executable.
	
So far I have tested only on cygwin and VC++. But this
should work on all systems.

ACKNOWLEGEMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	The Idea of RawVideoPlayer was inspired by the 'MULTIPLAYER'
	program written by Gopal G. K. 
		http://multiplayer.sourceforge.net

	Also I would like to thank all the people in the open source
	community. The examples and tutorials on OpenGL, and help
	from a lot of forums helped me use the OpenGL utilities for
	Video Rendering. Finally I would like to thank the people
	behind sourceforge.net for allowing me to host the project
	on their site.
